# 88. Merge Sorted Array
Solved
Easy

You are given two integer arrays nums1 and nums2, sorted in non-decreasing order, and two integers m and n, representing the number of elements in nums1 and nums2 respectively.

Merge nums1 and nums2 into a single array sorted in non-decreasing order.

The final sorted array should not be returned by the function, but instead be stored inside the array nums1. To accommodate this, nums1 has a length of m + n, where the first m elements denote the elements that should be merged, and the last n elements are set to 0 and should be ignored. nums2 has a length of n.

Approach:
Since the first array is long enough to hold both arrays, start inserting numbers from the back of the array. 
Use 2 pointers for each of the array and 1 pointer for intertions
