You are given the root of a binary tree with n nodes. Each node is uniquely assigned a value from 1 to n. You are also given an integer startValue representing the value of the start node s, and a different integer destValue representing the value of the destination node t.

Find the shortest path starting from node s and ending at node t. Generate step-by-step directions of such path as a string consisting of only the uppercase letters 'L', 'R', and 'U'. Each letter indicates a specific direction:

'L' means to go from a node to its left child node.
'R' means to go from a node to its right child node.
'U' means to go from a node to its parent node.
Return the step-by-step directions of the shortest path from node s to node t.

Example 1:
Input: root = [5,1,2,3,null,6,4], startValue = 3, destValue = 6
Output: "UURL"
Explanation: The shortest path is: 3 → 1 → 5 → 2 → 6.

# Approach
- Least Common Ancestor
- Find the path from the root node to start node and to the destination node
- LCA is the path common between them starting from the root
- Remove it and the rest of destination path is reversed to get the result path 
- Convert all the start path to "U" to represent going up from child to parent
